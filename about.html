                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Born in San Cristobal, Venezuela, my journey began with a passion for engineering and a drive to make a difference. At 17, I embarked on an international adventure, moving to Gainesville, Florida to pursue Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida, specializing in Instrumentation and Measurements.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        This foundation set the stage for an exhilarating start to my career at the University of Florida's Hurricane Research center. Here, I honed my skills in instrumentation and real-time data acquisition, chasing hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Wilma. This experience not only sharpened my technical abilities but also instilled a deep appreciation for the power of data in understanding and mitigating natural phenomena.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        My career then took me across the globe as a Field Engineer for Schlumberger, where I worked in Integrated Project Management and Rig Management. Operating in Oman and Venezuela, both onshore and offshore, I gained invaluable experience in Oil and Gas Drilling and Workover Operations. This role taught me the importance of adaptability, precision, and leadership in high-stakes environments.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Around this time, I made the significant decision to move to Canada, embarking on a new chapter in both my personal and professional life. Transitioning into Quality Control and Assurance, I oversaw critical inspections of drilling equipment, further developing my eye for detail and commitment to excellence. This experience laid the groundwork for my next role as a Quality Specialist, where I spent six years focusing on root cause analysis, incident management, and continuous improvement for companies designing and manufacturing Oil and Gas equipment.
