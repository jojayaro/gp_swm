        <p class="mb-4">
            Solar Wind Monitor is a real-time dashboard that displays
            various solar wind parameters and their effects on Earth's
            magnetosphere. This tool is designed to help space weather
            enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in
            solar-terrestrial physics to monitor current space weather
            conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The data displayed on this dashboard is sourced from various
            space weather monitoring services, including NOAA's Space
            Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).
