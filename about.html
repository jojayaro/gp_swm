                    From Venezuela to the Frontiers of Technology
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Born in San Cristobal, Venezuela, my journey began with a
                    passion for engineering and a drive to make a difference. At
                    17, I embarked on an international adventure, moving to
                    Gainesville, Florida to pursue Mechanical Engineering at the
                    University of Florida, specializing in Instrumentation and
                    Measurements.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This foundation set the stage for an exhilarating start to
                    my career at the University of Florida's Hurricane Research
                    center. Here, I honed my skills in instrumentation and
                    real-time data acquisition, chasing hurricanes Dennis,
                    Katrina, and Wilma. This experience not only sharpened my
                    technical abilities but also instilled a deep appreciation
                    for the power of data in understanding and mitigating
                    natural phenomena.

                    Global Impact in Oil and Gas
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    My career then took me across the globe as a Field Engineer
                    for Schlumberger, where I worked in Integrated Project
                    Management and Rig Management. Operating in Oman and
                    Venezuela, both onshore and offshore, I gained invaluable
                    experience in Oil and Gas Drilling and Workover Operations.
                    This role taught me the importance of adaptability,
                    precision, and leadership in high-stakes environments.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Around this time, I made the significant decision to move to
                    Canada, embarking on a new chapter in both my personal and
                    professional life. Transitioning into Quality Control and
                    Assurance, I oversaw critical inspections of drilling
                    equipment, further developing my eye for detail and
                    commitment to excellence. This experience laid the
                    groundwork for my next role as a Quality Specialist, where I
                    spent six years focusing on root cause analysis, incident
                    management, and continuous improvement for companies
                    designing and manufacturing Oil and Gas equipment.

                    Recognizing the growing importance of technology in
                    industry, I pivoted to application and automation
                    development in the financial sector. This role allowed me to
                    merge my engineering background with cutting-edge software
                    solutions, creating efficient systems that streamlined
                    operations.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    My journey then led me to data engineering, where I applied
                    my diverse skill set to perform data analytics and business
                    intelligence for equipment in the oil and gas, farming, and
                    mining industries. Today, I continue to push the boundaries
                    of what's possible with data as a Data Engineer at a leading
                    financial institution.
